* _Protecting People and Organizations_
** Have you and your friends ever played the game where you assign dog breeds to one another based on attitude, disposition, and appearance?  Whenever my friends and I play that game, I'm always assigned some sort of Shepherd or Sheepdog.  Partly because of my beard, but mostly because my friends recognize that protecting my flock is one of my core values as a person. 
 Protecting the people on my various teams in life is something that brings me great joy in and outside of the professional world.  When I was looking at which direction to take my professional career into a field that I'm more linked with - Cybersecurity was something that I kept coming back to.
